# Web UI

Odibi includes a web dashboard for viewing pipeline status, browsing story reports, and inspecting configuration.

## Overview

The UI is a FastAPI application with three main views:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/` | Pipeline dashboard — status, last run, node counts |
| `/stories` | Story browser — HTML reports from past runs |
| `/config` | Config viewer — current YAML configuration |

## Starting the UI

```bash
# Start with a specific config file
odibi ui config.yaml

# Or set via environment variable
export ODIBI_CONFIG=config.yaml
odibi ui
```

The server runs on `http://localhost:8000` by default.

## Dashboard (`/`)

The main dashboard shows:

- **Pipeline name**: Each pipeline defined in your config
- **Last run**: Timestamp of most recent execution
- **Status**: SUCCESS, FAILED, or UNKNOWN
- **Node counts**: Total nodes and successful nodes

Status is determined by checking node results:
- All nodes succeeded → SUCCESS
- Any node failed → FAILED
- No nodes → UNKNOWN

## Stories Browser (`/stories`)

Browse HTML story reports generated by pipeline runs.

Features:
- Lists all runs organized by pipeline → date → report
- Links to view full HTML reports
- Sorted by date (newest first)

Story files are served from the configured story path:

```yaml
story:
  connection: system
  path: stories/
```

## Config Viewer (`/config`)

View the current YAML configuration:

- Read-only view of your pipeline config
- Useful for debugging and verification
- Shows which config file is loaded

## Configuration

The UI reads configuration from:

1. `ODIBI_CONFIG` environment variable
2. Default locations: `odibi.yaml`, `odibi.yml`, `project.yaml`

Story paths are resolved from the `story` and `connections` config.

## Programmatic Usage

Use the FastAPI app directly:

```python
from odibi.ui.app import app
import uvicorn

# Run with custom settings
uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
```
