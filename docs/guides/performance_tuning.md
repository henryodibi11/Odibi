# Performance Tuning Guide

Odibi v2.2 introduces a "High-Performance Core" designed to handle everything from local laptop development to petabyte-scale Spark jobs. This guide explains the optimizations available and how to use them.

## 🚀 Quick Start

For 90% of users, just add this to your `odibi.yaml`:

```yaml
performance:
  use_arrow: true  # Massive speedup for Pandas I/O
```

## 1. Pandas Engine Optimizations

The Pandas engine is designed for speed on a single machine.

### 🏹 Apache Arrow Backend (`use_arrow: true`)

**What it does:**
Replaces standard NumPy memory layout with **Apache Arrow**. Arrow is a columnar memory format that allows "Zero-Copy" data transfer.

**Why use it?**
-   **Speed:** Reading Parquet files becomes nearly instant because the data maps directly from disk to memory without conversion overhead.
-   **Memory:** Reduces RAM usage by ~50% for string-heavy datasets (no more Python objects for strings).

**Configuration:**
```yaml
# odibi.yaml
performance:
  use_arrow: true
```

### ⚡ Parallel File I/O (Multi-Threading)

**What it does:**
When reading multiple files (e.g., `path: data/sales_*.csv`), Odibi now uses a thread pool to read them in parallel instead of one by one.

**Why use it?**
Pandas is normally single-threaded. If you have 8 CPU cores, reading 50 CSV files sequentially wastes 7 of them. Parallel I/O saturates your CPU/Disk bandwidth for linear speedups.

**How to use:**
Automatic! Just use a glob pattern in your path:
```yaml
read:
  path: raw/data_*.csv  # <--- Parallel reading activates automatically
```

## 2. Spark Engine Optimizations

The Spark engine focuses on "Data Layout" optimizations—making sure downstream queries are fast.

### 💧 Liquid Clustering (`cluster_by`)

**What it does:**
Replaces traditional Hive-style partitioning (`year=2023/month=01`) with a flexible, dynamic clustering system. It physically groups related data together in the files.

**Why use it?**
-   **No "Small File" Problem:** Traditional partitioning creates too many tiny files if you pick the wrong column (e.g., `user_id`). Liquid handles this automatically.
-   **Skew Resistance:** Handles uneven data (e.g., 90% of users in US, 1% in JP) without performance cliffs.
-   **Query Speed:** Massive data skipping. Queries filtering by clustered columns skip 99% of the file scans.

**How to use:**
Add `cluster_by` to your write node. If the table doesn't exist, Odibi creates it with clustering enabled.

```yaml
- name: write_sales
  write:
    table: silver.sales
    mode: append
    options:
      cluster_by: [region, date]  # <--- Enables Liquid Clustering
      optimize_write: true        # <--- Keeps clustering healthy
```

### 🧹 Auto-Optimization (`optimize_write`)

**What it does:**
Runs the Delta Lake `OPTIMIZE` command immediately after a write/merge operation.

**Why use it?**
Streaming and frequent batch jobs create "small files" (fragmentation) which kill read performance. This option compacts them into larger, efficient files (Bin-packing) and enforces clustering (Z-Order/Liquid).

**Configuration:**
```yaml
# In a standard Write node
options:
  optimize_write: true

# In a Merge Transformer
params:
  optimize_write: true
```

### 🌊 Streaming Support

**What it does:**
Allows you to switch from Batch (`read`/`write`) to Streaming (`readStream`/`writeStream`) with a single flag.

**Why use it?**
For real-time latency or processing infinite datasets (Kafka, Auto-Loader) without managing state manually.

**How to use:**
```yaml
- name: read_stream
  read:
    streaming: true  # <--- Activates Spark Structured Streaming
    format: cloudFiles
    path: raw_landing/
```

## 3. Polars Engine Optimizations

The Polars engine is a lightweight, fast alternative to Pandas with native Rust performance.

### 🦺 Lazy Execution

**What it does:**
Polars uses a lazy execution model where queries are not executed until you call `.collect()`. This allows the query optimizer to reorder, combine, and skip operations.

**Why use it?**
-   **Query Optimization:** Predicate pushdown, projection pruning, and filter hoisting happen automatically.
-   **Memory Efficiency:** Only columns you need are loaded into memory.
-   **Performance:** Often 5-10x faster than Pandas for analytical workloads.

**How to use:**
Set your engine to Polars and Odibi handles lazy evaluation automatically:
```yaml
engine: polars
```

### 📂 Scan Methods (Streaming Large Files)

**What it does:**
Uses `scan_csv`, `scan_parquet`, and `scan_ndjson` to read files lazily without loading them entirely into memory.

**Why use it?**
Process files larger than RAM by streaming them in chunks.

**Automatic:** Odibi's Polars engine uses scan methods by default for supported formats.

### ⚡ Native Parallelism

**What it does:**
Polars uses all available CPU cores automatically—no configuration needed.

**Why use it?**
Unlike Pandas (single-threaded), Polars parallelizes operations like groupby, join, and filter across all cores.
