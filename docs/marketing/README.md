## Quick Start

1. **Week 1**: Start with Phase 1, Post 1.1 (Your Origin Story)
2. **Post 3x/week**: Monday, Wednesday, Friday works well
3. **Time**: 8-10am your timezone for best reach
4. **Engage**: Respond to every comment within 24 hours

## Content Strategy

### Phase 1: Don't Mention Odibi
Build credibility first. Share your story, lessons learned. No product pitch.

### Phase 2: Introduce Odibi Gradually
By week 10, reveal that you've been using Odibi for the series.

### Phase 3-4: Establish Expertise
Deep technical content. Show you know your stuff.

### Phase 5: Community Building
Invite collaboration, thank followers, call to action.

## Tone Guidelines

✅ **Do:**
- Share real mistakes and lessons
- Use "I" not "we" (personal brand)
- Be humble: "I'm still learning"
- Ask questions to drive engagement
- Use specific numbers and examples

❌ **Don't:**
- Mention your company by name
- Complain about specific people
- Be preachy or lecture-y
- Use corporate speak
- Oversell Odibi

## Dataset

The series uses the [Brazilian E-Commerce dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) from Kaggle.

Download and set it up before Week 3.

## Tracking Success
