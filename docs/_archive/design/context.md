## 🧑‍💻 Who Henry Is

Henry Odibi is a **Data Engineer** focused on building open-source frameworks that make data engineering easier, more enjoyable, and more accessible to learners and practitioners alike.

He bridges **plant-floor operations and cloud architecture**, designing truth-preserving, self-evolving data systems that power reliability, yield intelligence, and energy optimization across manufacturing sites.

His background combines **Chemical Engineering** (Texas Tech University) with hands-on experience in **data transformation, process automation, and manufacturing intelligence** — primarily at Ingredion Incorporated, where he transformed raw operational data into high-performance analytical systems.

Henry works independently and uses AI agents (like AMP) as **collaborators, not replacements**. His approach is strategic, analytical, and intentionally iterative — favoring small, deliberate phases over big-bang releases.

## 🎯 Vision and Motivation

**Mission:**  
Make data engineering easier, reduce the barrier to entry, and make it enjoyable to learn.

Henry believes that data systems shouldn't just work — they should **teach, evolve, and empower**. His frameworks are designed to be:
- **Declarative** (explicit over implicit)
- **Story-driven** (self-documenting pipelines)
- **Accessible** (learnable by juniors, scalable for experts)

He's building **odibi** (formerly odibi_de_v3.2) as a dual-engine (Pandas + Spark), config-driven framework that embodies these principles.

---

## 🔬 Current Focus

Henry is refactoring his private framework into a **production-grade open-source project**:

- **Phase 1** (in progress): Scaffolding Spark engine + Azure integrations without breaking the existing Pandas MVP
- **Phase 2** (planned): CLI tools, testing utilities, and developer experience improvements
- **Phase 3+** (future): Story generation, advanced connectors (AWS, GCP), performance optimization, and community ecosystem

Current technical stack:
- **Azure** (Data Lake, SQL Database, Databricks)
- **Pandas + Spark** (dual-engine execution)
- **Pydantic** (config validation)
- **YAML** (declarative pipelines)
- **Python 3.9+** (type hints, modern practices)

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Truth-Preserving Systems**  
   Data systems must maintain lineage, traceability, and auditability. Every transformation is documented; every decision is traceable.

2. **Explicit Over Implicit**  
   Magic is convenient but dangerous. Henry prefers clear, declarative configs over hidden abstractions.

3. **Self-Evolving Design**  
   Systems should generate their own documentation (stories), adapt to schema changes, and surface insights automatically.

4. **Small, Deliberate Phases**  
   Big thinking, small steps. Each phase delivers value, builds on the last, and leaves artifacts (code, docs, tests).

5. **Teach While Building**  
   Every commit should either teach, automate, or clarify. Documentation is a first-class deliverable.

6. **Community-First Open Source**  
   Open-source isn't just about code — it's about governance, onboarding, and making it easy for others to contribute.

## 🤝 Guiding Principle

> **"Use AI as an amplifier, not an autopilot."**

Henry leverages AI to:
- Structure and refine ideas
- Generate boilerplate and tests
- Maintain clarity across a growing codebase
- Accelerate delivery without sacrificing quality

But he **always reviews, critiques, and owns the decisions**. AI is a thought partner, not a replacement for engineering judgment.

---

## ✨ Afro-Futurist Identity

Henry operates with a confident **Afro-futurist energy**, blending deep systems thinking with creativity, culture, and purpose. For him, open source is not only technical — it is **legacy building**. His work embodies the principle that technology can empower communities, preserve knowledge, and create pathways for the next generation. He designs systems that don't just process data — they tell stories, evolve intelligently, and honor the people who depend on them.

## 🌐 LinkedIn Insights

Henry's professional presence reflects a **proactive, hands-on, growth-oriented philosophy**. Recurring themes include:

- **Continuous Learning**: Actively shares technical discoveries (Docker, WSL2, Spark containerization) with step-by-step breakdowns and "aha!" moments.
- **Automation as a Force Multiplier**: Views automation as essential for efficiency in both data pipelines and manufacturing operations.
- **Manufacturing Intelligence**: Deep focus on extracting actionable insights from process data to improve safety, yield, and energy efficiency.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Regularly posts about certifications (Transact-SQL), learning journeys, and practical tips — framed to educate and inspire his network.
- **Community Engagement**: Participates in career fairs, Juneteenth events, and professional outreach — demonstrating commitment to diversity, inclusion, and giving back.

His **communication style** is:
- **Informative and practical** (no fluff, just value)
- **Encouraging and collaborative** (celebrates others' achievements, shares opportunities)
- **Purpose-driven** (connects work to the "why" — business impact, operational excellence, community benefit)

Henry approaches challenges with a **problem-solving mindset**, often documenting his learning process to demystify complex topics and encourage others to embrace new skills.

## 🚀 How AI Supports the Mission

AI agents like AMP help Henry:

1. **Plan Work in Structured Steps**  
   Break large goals into phased deliverables with clear success criteria.

2. **Explain *Why* Before Executing**  
   Provide reasoning, tradeoffs, and architectural context — not just code.

3. **Create Reusable Patterns and Documentation**  
   Build once, use everywhere. Every feature comes with tests, docs, and examples.

4. **Teach Concepts While Building**  
   Don't just implement — explain the design decisions, patterns, and best practices.

5. **Maintain Clarity Across Growth**  
   As the codebase expands, keep it organized, navigable, and welcoming to new contributors.
