    "Welcome. This notebook is the foundation for everything that follows. By the end of it, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create and use variables of every basic type\n",
    "- Work with strings confidently (f-strings, methods, formatting)\n",
    "- Write functions that take inputs and return outputs\n",
    "- Use if/elif/else to control what your code does\n",
    "- Write loops that repeat work\n",
    "- Handle errors without your program crashing\n",

    "Every example in this notebook uses real Odibi concepts. You are not learning Python in a vacuum --\n",
    "you are learning it through the framework you built.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules:**\n",
    "1. Type every line of code yourself. Do not copy-paste.\n",
    "2. Run every cell. Reading is not enough.\n",
    "3. If you get an error, read the error message carefully before asking for help.\n",

    "\n",
    "Python is a **programming language**. That means it is a set of rules for writing instructions that a computer can follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the most important thing to understand: **Python reads your code one line at a time, from top to bottom.** This is called being \"interpreted.\" Some languages (like C or Java) need to be compiled -- translated into machine code -- before they run. Python skips that step. You write code, you run it, you see the result immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write a `.py` file (like the files in Odibi), Python reads line 1, executes it, then line 2, executes it, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter notebook, you work with **cells**. Each cell is a chunk of code or text. When you run a code cell (Shift+Enter), Python executes just that cell. This lets you experiment piece by piece instead of running an entire file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Odibi is written in Python because:\n",
    "- Python is the standard language for data engineering\n",
    "- Libraries like Pandas, PySpark, and Polars are all Python\n",
    "- It is readable and practical -- you can build real systems quickly\n",
    "\n",
