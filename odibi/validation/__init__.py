Quality Enforcement and Validation
===================================

This module enforces Odibi's quality standards through automated validation.

Planned features (Phase 3):
- Explanation linting: Ensure transformations are documented
- Quality scoring: Detect generic/lazy documentation
- Schema validation: Verify config structure
- Pre-run validation: Catch errors before execution

Principle: Enforce excellence, don't hope for it.
