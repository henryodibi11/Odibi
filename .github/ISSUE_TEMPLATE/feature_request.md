## Problem Statement

A clear description of the problem you're trying to solve.

Example: "I'm always frustrated when I have to manually track which records changed..."

## Proposed Solution

Describe what you'd like to happen:

```yaml
# If applicable, show what the YAML config might look like
```

## Use Case

Describe your real-world use case:

- What pipeline are you building?
- What data sources are involved?
- What's the business goal?

## Alternatives Considered

What other approaches have you considered? Why wouldn't they work?

## Evidence of Need

Odibi follows the [Chimera Mindset](../docs/philosophy.md#the-chimera-mindset): features are added based on real usage.

- Have you encountered this need multiple times?
- Do you have working code that solves this today (even if ugly)?
- Would this benefit other users beyond your specific case?

## Additional Context

Any other context, screenshots, or references (e.g., how other tools handle this).
